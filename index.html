  So this is my second javascript project. I finished on 2023/08/23. @ 12.11 P.M.
  The main issue in my mind is uncertainity. 
  At this time I am a chemistry teacher who has computer science as a subject in her b.sc. degree. 
  So career chanage is my target. But can I do it? I am not sure. 
  I did this for now. And still I am shaking. 
  But I really need this career change. Thats all I know.
